        <p><br>Protecting sensitive data and important systems from online threats is known as cybersecurity.</br> <br>Cybersecurity measures, also referred to as information technology (IT) security, are intended to counter attacks to networked systems and applications, whether those threats come from within or outside of an organisation.</br> <br> These expenses may be increased by the complexity of security systems brought on by dissimilar technologies and a lack of internal expertise.</br> <br> But, businesses that have a thorough cybersecurity plan that is automated utilising advanced analytics, artificial intelligence (AI), and machine learning can combat cyberthreats more successfully and lessen the impact of breaches when they do happen.</br></p>
